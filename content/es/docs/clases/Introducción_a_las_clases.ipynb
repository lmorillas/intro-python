    "\n",
    "Classes are the foundation of object-oriented programming. Classes\n",
    "represent real-world things you want to model in your programs: for\n",
    "example dogs, cars, and robots. You use a class to make objects, which\n",
    "are specific instances of dogs, cars, and robots. A class defines the\n",
    "general behavior that a whole category of objects can have, and the\n",
    "information that can be associated with those objects. Classes can\n",
    "inherit from each other – you can write a class that extends the\n",
    "functionality of an existing class. This allows you to code efficiently\n",
    "for a wide variety of situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a class\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider how we might model a car. What information would we associate\n",
    "with a car, and what behavior would it have? The information is stored\n",
    "in variables called attributes, and the behavior is represented by\n",
    "functions. Functions that are part of a class are called methods.\n",
